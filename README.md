# BestClassifier01_LoanCase
In this project I tried to find out the best classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paidoff or not. The dataset I used is about past loans of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.  
  
Algorithms used to build model:
- k-Nearest Neighbor
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression  
  
Metrics used to findout accuracy of classifiers:
- F1 Score  
- Jaccard Index  
- Log-Loss
